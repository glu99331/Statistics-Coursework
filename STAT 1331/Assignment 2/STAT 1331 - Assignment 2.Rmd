## Problem 1:
Let {$x_t$ for t = ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} be a time series process.
1a) What does it mean when we say $x_t$ is weakly stationary?

### Solution:
For $x_t$ to be regarded as a weakly stationary process if it has constant mean and variance, and the covariance between $x_{t1}$ and $x_{t2}$ depends on $t_1$ and $t_2$ only through time distance |${t_1 - t_2}$|
